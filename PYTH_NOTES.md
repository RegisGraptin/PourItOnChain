## Pyth Notes on entropy doc

On the documentation, regarding the workflow, I think some improvment can be made for the entropy from my point of view.


## Unknown `entropyProvider` at the start

When readed the first time the documentation, it was a bit confusing for me to see `entropyProvider` parameter without being defining in the first code.

```solidity
function requestRandomNumber(bytes32 userRandomNumber) external payable {
  uint256 fee = entropy.getFee(entropyProvider);
 
  uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.requestWithCallback{ value: fee }(
    entropyProvider,
    userRandomNumber
  );
}
```

I mean, in my implementation workflow, I was kind of copy past the previous part of the code, and get a bit lost here, especially where in the code bellow, we have this variable defined:


```solidity
  ...
  
  // @param userRandomNumber The random number generated by the user.
  function requestRandomNumber(bytes32 userRandomNumber) external payable {
    // Get the default provider and the fee for the request
    address entropyProvider = entropy.getDefaultProvider(); // <--- Defined here
    uint256 fee = entropy.getFee(entropyProvider);
 
    // SKIP

  }
```

Now we have `address entropyProvider = entropy.getDefaultProvider();`. It can be a bit frustating to play the game of 7 differences especially for code we are not familiar.


## Highlight the 'getEntropy()' function

It may be interesting to highlight the `getEntropy()` function. I mean, I see that I needed to implement it after compiling my smart contract, as it was not mention in the text here (https://docs.pyth.network/entropy/generate-random-numbers/evm) only in the code. And as the part highlight was not this one, I did not take too much attention here.

```solidity
function getEntropy() internal view override returns (address) {
    return address(entropy);
  }
```


## Remarks

> Good to see reference materials or "best practices".
> Not that much code example (Notice: https://docs.pyth.network/entropy/examples deadlink for CoinFlip)
